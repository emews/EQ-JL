# EQ-JL: EMEWS Queues - Julia implementation

There are currently the following examples (see their Readmes):

- Example: [noop](example/noop) - This is only for those interested in learning how the EMEWS queues work.
- Example: [ga0](example/ga0) - A "pure math" genetic algorithm in Swift

## ⚠️ Swift-t version working with Julia 1.5

EQ-JL is designed on top of Julia 1.5. For this reason, you must be sure that your version of Swift-t has enabled Julia 1.5. For installing Swift-t with Julia 1.5, you can follow our [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md), as well as a installation script of Swift-t and EQ-JL working on Amazon EC2 Ubuntu instance.
